# ♟️ FENGEN

An attempt at multi-class neural network for generating FEN strings.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have `nix` installed.
2. In the project root directory: `nix-shell`
3. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
4. Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
5. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
  
Then, you can use a live server to hot reload changes.
