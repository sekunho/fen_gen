  Asynchronously parses and evaluates the given code.

  Container isolates a group of evaluations. Every evaluation can use previous
  evaluation's environment and bindings, as long as they belong to the same container.

  Evaluation outputs are send to the connected runtime owner.
  The messages should be of the form:

  * `{:evaluation_stdout, ref, string}` - output captured during evaluation
  * `{:evaluation_response, ref, response}` - final result of the evaluation

  If the evaluation state within a container is lost (e.g. a process goes down),
  the runtime can send `{:container_down, container_ref, message}` to notify the owner.

  ## Options

  * `:file` - file to which the evaluated code belongs. Most importantly,
    this has an impact on the value of `__DIR__`.
