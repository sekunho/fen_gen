  # Behaviour defining how evaluation results are transformed.
  #
  # The evaluation response is sent to the client as a message
  # and it may potentially be huge. If the client eventually
  # converts the result into some smaller representation,
  # we would unnecessarily send a lot of data.
  # By defining a custom formatter the client can instruct
  # the `Evaluator` to send already transformed data.
